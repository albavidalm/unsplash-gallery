### API Reference

This project is created by working with the Unsplash API.

You can find all the API information and documentation here: https://unsplash.com/documentation

All API requests require the use of a generated API key, so to run the project you will need your own API key and you can generate this API key here: https://unsplash.com/join

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `key`     | `string` | **Required**. Your API key |

Due I needed list of pictures and its information I worked with the next **endpoint**:

[**List photos**](https://unsplash.com/documentation#list-photos)

```http
GET /photos
```

### What happens on the web?

- The first time the user enters the website, the API will be "called" and it will return 13 images, as this is how I have configured the endpoint.

- When the user clicks on the "Cargar mÃ¡s fotos" button, the randomPage() function is called, which will generate a random number that will be the new page number where the API will take us in this new call that we are also activating when clicking.

<br>

### What I learned

- I discovered this challenge two days before the deadline so I had to create it in a few hours when I got back from work.

- I focused on the end goal, I tried to replicate the design as much as I could.

- Being aware that you can't achieve everything and being calm with the decision has been the biggest learning from this project.

## Further implementations

- Click a picture and open it in raw format in a new tab
- Change the text color depending on the image color
- Apply testing
- Refactor
- Atomise
